Simple Discord bot for the [Meet Your Maker](https://meetyourmakergame.com/) community [server](https://discord.com/invite/meetyourmaker).

It helps with counting votes when running level builder contests: participants make submissions by creating posts in a forum channel, and other players are then encouraged to play them, and vote by leaving custom emoji reactions on the posts.
There are multiple categories in the contest, and one 'overall best' category on top.
